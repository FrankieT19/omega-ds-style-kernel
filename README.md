# DS Style Kernel for EZ-FLASH OMEGA

DS Style is a custom kernel for the **original EZ-FLASH OMEGA**. It is based on the official EZ-FLASH OMEGA kernel source and Sterophonick's SimpleLight custom kernel and adapts the DS Style launcher experience for the original cartridge model.

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is for the **original EZ-FLASH OMEGA only**. Do not flash this build to the EZ-FLASH OMEGA Definitive Edition.

## User Guide

Read the complete [DS Style User Guide](https://frankiet19.github.io/omega-de-ds-style-kernel/) for installation, everyday use, artwork, customisation and troubleshooting.

## Features

- DS-style launcher interface
- Multiple colour themes and light/dark presentation support
- Customisable launcher assets through DS Style Customiser
- List, List + Art, horizontal carousel, and vertical carousel file views
- Title and box-art thumbnail modes
- Favourite and recent game support
- Multi-language launcher text, including Chinese and Thai
- UI sounds
- Runtime settings stored in readable `SYSTEM/SETTINGS.TXT`

## Building

Install devkitPro/devkitARM, then run:

```bat
build.bat
```

The build script outputs:

```text
ezkernel.bin
```

Copy `ezkernel.bin` to the root of the SD card and boot the cartridge while holding **R** to update the kernel.

## Skin Assets

Theme image headers are generated from the files in `images/` using:

```bat
Grit\Build Skin Files.bat
```

Run this before building if you edit the theme BMP/PNG/JPG assets.

## Customising

For normal users, the recommended route is **DS Style Customiser**, which creates a private project copy, edits the assets/settings, and builds the kernel without modifying this source tree directly.

The original OMEGA's smaller kernel size limit does not leave room for separate Custom Theme or Custom Colour slots. Edit one of the existing colour slots and its top bar and icons instead.
